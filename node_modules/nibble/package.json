  "readme": "# Nibble!\n\nNibble is a CSS framework built on top of [nib] and strongly influenced by\n[foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).\n\nIt provides a grid system and basic elements like buttons and menu items.\n\n> It's like nibbling on a flying spaghetti monster's tentakle.\n\n**Lots** (maybe all) of the credit goes to\n[foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com). I have taken many ideas and lots of\nCSS code from their lib. I'm just not that big of a SCSS fan...\n\n\n# Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install nibble\n```\n\nMake sure you also install [nib].\n\nThis is an example how you would include *nib* and *nibble* in your framework:\n\n```javascript\nvar connect = require('connect')\n  , stylus = require('stylus')\n  , nib = require('nib')\n  , nibble = require('nibble');\n\nvar server = connect();\n\nfunction compile(str, path) {\n  return stylus(str)\n    .set('filename', path)\n    .set('compress', true)\n    .use(nib()\n    .use(nibble());\n}\n\nserver.use(stylus.middleware({\n    src: __dirname\n  , compile: compile\n}));\n```\n\n\n# Documentation\n\nTo include all of nibble's elements you write this in your `.styl` file:\n\n```stylus\n@import \"nibble\"\n```\n\nThis includes *nib* and all of *nibble's* functionality.\n\nYou can also cherrypick the components you want instead of importing the whole lib.\nIn this case, make sure that you include the `settings.styl` file\n\n```stylus\n@import \"nibble/settings\"\n```\n\nI'll add more documentation soon. Please refer to the nibble folder for now on\nwhich elements exist.\n\n\n\n[nib]: http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/",
