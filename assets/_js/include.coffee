# Foundation framework JavaScript â€”currently 
#
# We don't use the full Foundation JavaScript because it includes its own
# version of JQuery and Modernizr, and we don't need everything in it. Instead,
# we use only the parts that we need and include our own (compatible) JQuery
# and Modernizr.
#
# This is how to import all Foundation components at once:
# require libs/foundation/foundation.min.js

# require libs/foundation/jquery.placeholder.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.accordion.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.alerts.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.buttons.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.clearing.js
#= require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.forms.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.joyride.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.magellan.js
#= require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.mediaQueryToggle.js
#= require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.navigation.js
#= require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.orbit.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.reveal.js
#= require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.tabs.js
# require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.tooltips.js
#= require libs/foundation/jquery.foundation.topbar.js
#= require libs/foundation/app.js
#= require plugins.js


#
# Dependencies at the top. These will be prepended to the code below by
# connect-assets, which uses Snockets.  These require statements must be the
# first lines of the file. Required files are specified relative to this file.
# If you want to lighten things up, you can remove libs/foundation/app.js and
# require only the foundation scripts you currently need.
#


# Our own site-specific JavaScript
#= require application
